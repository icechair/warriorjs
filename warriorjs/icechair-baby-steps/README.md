# icechair - Baby Steps

### _For players new to WarriorJS_

## Level 5

_You hear cries for help. Captives must need rescuing._

> **TIP:** Combine `warrior.feel().getUnit().isEnemy()` and `warrior.feel().getUnit().isBound()` to see if there's a captive, and `warrior.rescue()` to rescue him. Don't attack captives.
